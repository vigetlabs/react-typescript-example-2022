# React TypeScript Example (2022)

This repo contains a React app written in TypeScript using vite as a bundler
and build tool. Its purpose is to document and demonstrate the JS Dev team's
opinions, best practices, preferred libraries, testing methodology,
and application architecture.

**Note**: This repo represents a snapshot in time. The frontend development
landscape is notorious for changing rapidly. It is not expected for this project
to be maintained and adapted over time, though contributions are welcome.

## Setup

```bash
$ bin/setup
```

### Run the app

```bash
$ bin/server
```
